## About

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS. The goal of this rewrite is to create 
a version capable of targeting multiple platforms & frameworks with minimal dependencies, 
but still provide a flexible & high performance CMS library.

Piranha is currently built for `.NET 6` and uses in its simplest form the following awesome packages:

* [AutoMapper](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper)
* [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig)
* [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore)
* [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
* An IDE or Editor of your choice

### Create a new project from our templates

To use our project templates you first need to download and install them from NuGet. This can be done with:

~~~ bash
dotnet new -i Piranha.Templates
~~~

When creating a new project with `dotnet new` you should first create a new empty folder. The default behaviour is that the new project is **named after its containing folder**.

> Please note that naming your project `Piranha` (even if it is a test project) will result in a circular reference error when you try to restore the packages. This is due to a limitation in `dotnet restore`.

After this is done you can create a new web project for razor pages with:

~~~ bash
dotnet new piranha.razor
~~~

To read more about of our available project templates, please read more on https://piranhacms.org/docs/basics/project-templates

### Get the latest source code and get going

~~~
> git clone https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core.git
> cd piranha.core
> dotnet restore
> dotnet build
> cd examples/MvcWeb
> dotnet run
~~~

### Log into the Manager

The manager interface can be found at the URL `~/manager` with the default credentials:

~~~
admin / password
~~~

For production scenarios we advise you to remove this user, or change the password
**and** update the password strength policy. More information on this can be found in
the [official documentation here](http://piranhacms.org/docs/architecture/authentication/identity).

### Build and update javascript/css assets

~~~
> cd piranha.core/core/Piranha.Manager
> npm install
> gulp min:js
> gulp min:css
~~~

### Visual Studio users

For people running Visual Studio 2017 almost all of the above steps will be handled by the IDE. Just get the source code, open the `.sln` file and you're good to go.
