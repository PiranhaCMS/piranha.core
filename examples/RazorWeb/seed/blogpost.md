Piranha CMS is a **lightweight**, **unobtrusive** and **cross-platform** CMS library for `NetStandard` 2.0. It can be used to add CMS functionality to an already existing application, build new website from scratch, or even be used as a backend for a mobile application.

## Our Design Principles

When Piranha CMS was created back in 2011 we had a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve.

* An **open** and **extendible** platform.
* **Easy** and **intuitive** for the content administrators.
* **Fast**, **efficient** and **fun** for the developers.


We've never been interested in incorporating big, complex functions for enterprise customers, there are already lots of commercial products available for this segment. Instead we focus our efforts on providing **awesome** tools for small to medium sized customers who **doesn't know how to edit** their current web applications. These are the customers we meet every day.

Because in the end, if the customer doesn't understand how to maintain their own application, you should have just given them a static site to a fraction of the cost.

## What isn't Piranha

Piranha isn't, and will **never be** Wordpress. What we mean by this is, since we don't care **how** you build, or **what** kind of application you build, Piranha will never be able to  provide a shop full of pre-made Themes and Plugins that you can download.

The heart and soul of Piranha is about **structuring content** and **editing** it in the most intuitive way possible - the rest we leave up to you.
